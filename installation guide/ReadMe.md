## Why Arch Linux?
- Bloat-free (no preinstalled solitaire)
- Yours (no corporate "helpful" background services)
- Transparent (fully open source)
- Free (no need to activate like Windows)
- Helps you understand about the OS as you install
- Helps you explore and read the manual (Arch Wiki)
- Fully customizable from top to bottom
- No holding hands like other Linux distros
- Considered by many to be the most difficult OS to install
- Other distros have many unnecessary pre-installed software
- Hyprland will be easier to install
- Released on 2002 which is my birthyear
- Able to say "I use Arch, btw"
- Its logo is an 'A' and it's my favorite letter (I think)
